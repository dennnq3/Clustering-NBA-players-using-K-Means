This Python code analyzes NBA player statistics using K-Means clustering. It begins by importing necessary libraries like pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, and scikit-learn for scaling, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. The code loads a CSV file containing NBA season data. It then handles missing numerical values by filling them with zeros. A specific set of features related to player performance, such as minutes played, points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, turnovers, field goal percentage, three-point percentage, and free throw percentage, are selected for clustering.

The code then focuses on using RobustScaler to prepare the data for K-Means. It iterates through a range of possible cluster numbers (K from 2 to 10) and calculates the silhouette score and inertia for each K. The silhouette score measures how similar a player is to its own cluster compared to other clusters, while inertia represents the sum of squared distances of samples to their closest cluster center. These metrics help determine the optimal number of clusters. The calculated silhouette scores and inertia values for RobustScaler are displayed in tables and plotted to visualize the results of the silhouette method and the elbow method.

Based on the analysis (which indicated K=4 as potentially optimal for RobustScaler in the previous run), the code applies K-Means with 4 clusters using the RobustScaler data. The resulting cluster labels are added as a new column to the original DataFrame. To visualize the clusters, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is performed to reduce the dimensionality of the scaled data to two components, and a scatter plot of the first two principal components is generated, colored by the assigned cluster.

Further analysis involves calculating the mean of the selected features for each cluster to understand the typical characteristics of players within each group. The code also prints the number of players in each cluster.

Finally, the code compares the performance of RobustScaler with MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler by repeating the silhouette score and inertia calculations for each scaler across the range of K values. This comparison is presented in tables, showing how different scaling methods impact the clustering results. The code identifies and prints the combination of scaler and K that yielded the highest silhouette score across all tested scenarios.

Briefly about the results: The analysis with RobustScaler suggested K=4 as a reasonable number of clusters based on the silhouette and elbow methods. When comparing different scalers, MinMaxScaler with K=2 achieved the highest silhouette score among the tested combinations, although RobustScaler with K=4 showed a better performance when combined with elbow method results. The cluster analysis provides insights into the distinct playing styles or performance levels of players grouped into different clusters based on their statistics.
